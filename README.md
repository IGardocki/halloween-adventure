# The Halloween Adventure App

This was an app created as a short halloween story adventure for kids who are trick-or-treating. Simply download the QR code, print it out with a message explaining what it does, and hang it on your door for them or their parents to scan!

I just copied the QR code and pasted it into a word doc with this text above it:

Ready for a spooky halloween adventure? Have a trusted adult scan this QR code to get started!

But feel free to add your own twist!

### This QR code was generated by qr.io. The website makes generating QR codes very easy if you are ever interested.
